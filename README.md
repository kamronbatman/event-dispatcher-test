# Event Dispatcher Test

The event dispatcher test is about creating a way to de-couple events and callbacks.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hautelook/event-dispatcher-test.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/hautelook/event-dispatcher-test)

## Requirements

  * node.js 0.12 or higher

## Installation

  * Make sure you have a working internet connection.
  * Install npm packages by typing: `npm install`

Note: We expect installation to take only a few minutes to setup. If for any reason it is taking longer, please feel free to reach out to us. We are happy to [help](#support).

## Running Tests

After installation, confirm the tests are working:

```bash
$ npm test
```

There is also a watch task you can use to re-run all the tests if a change is detected:

```bash
$ npm run watch
```

The tests should complete without errors. The majority of the tests will be in a pending state. Please activate each test, individually, as you implement features.

## Code Layout

Here is a high level overview of the important files in this project:

  * `events.js` - the event dispatcher code.
  * `events.spec.js` - the Jasmine tests that define requirements for the event dispatcher.

## Challenge

The first scenario has been written for you. Please implement all remaining scenarios within events.js (event dispatcher can be used both server-side and client-side). We're looking for simplicity in architecture and the correctness of the code. Make whatever changes you want to the scenario implementations and source code to accomplish that goal. Once complete, please zip up the entire directory and email it back to us. If the zip file is too large, you can remove the npm dependencies and other temporary files.

We expect this to take 1-2 hours to complete.
